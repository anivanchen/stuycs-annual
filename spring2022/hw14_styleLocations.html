    <h2>Using Inline CSS</h2>
    <p>The benefits of using inline CSS include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows for quick style changes to a single element in an HTML document.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using CSS in the <code>style</code> Tag</h2>
    <p>The benefits of placing CSS between the <code>style</code> tags include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows for more complex style changes to an entire HTML document or elements used more than once.</li>
      <li>If an external stylesheet is used, CSS in the <code>style</code> tag can be used to override these values for only the document the changes are defined in.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Using an External Stuylesheet</h2>
    <p>The benefits of using an external stylesheet include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preventing your HTML document from becoming bloated with style attributes in individual elements or with the style tag by separating the presentation (CSS) from semantics (HTML).</li>
      <li>Allowing the defined styles to be used over multiple HTML documents as long as they are linked to the stylesheet.</li>
    </ul>

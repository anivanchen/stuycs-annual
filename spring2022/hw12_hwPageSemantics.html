    <h1>4D. Interpreting Tabbed Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>
      The semantics of a tabbed paragraph seems to denote that the text block 
      being indented is an extension of the previous, unindented block of text.
      It can be used to add further info onto the unindented paragraph or to
      further explain it.
    </p>

    <h1>5. Interpreting &lt;b&gt; tags</h1>
    <p>
      The &lt;b&gt; tag is properly used on the davidmholmes.net website. 
      The semantics of a bolded section of text seems to highlight important 
      keywords in a paragraph or group of text. It may also be used to 
      highlight the main point of a paragraph.
